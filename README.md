This is a simple Sudoku website created with Html, CSS and JS along with data in JSON. The implementation of the Sudoku generation has been done in 2 ways. 
1. In the som.js we have assigned the data values directly to the variable in the form of a 2D array and the generation of the Sudoku Table. This file can be used by simply changing the path in sudoku.js to som.js in the sudoku.html.
2. In the sudoku.js (which is the primary implementation being used here). Here the sudoku data is being fetched from the sudoku.json in the form of a string which is then being converted to a 2D array and then the sudoku is being generated.

This was a fun and yet a bit complicated project I did (Figuratively) considering the challenging part was the assigning the data from json to the 2D array. Also the reflection of the solution and submitted sudoku while Finishing was a bit challenging. All in all it was a simple yet complicated project which was a fun assignment.
